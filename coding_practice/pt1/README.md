# Part One: Introduction to C++ Data Types

Welcome to Part One of your C++ coding practice! In this section, we'll focus on understanding and using **data types** in C++. Data types are fundamental building blocks that determine what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.

## Common C++ Data Types

- **int**: Used to store integer values (e.g., `int age = 25;`).
- **double**: Used for floating-point (decimal) numbers (e.g., `double price = 19.99;`).
- **char**: Represents a single character (e.g., `char grade = 'A';`).
- **bool**: Stores boolean values: `true` or `false` (e.g., `bool isOpen = false;`).
- **string**: Used for sequences of characters (requires including the `<string>` header, e.g., `std::string name = "Melissa";`).

Each data type serves a specific purpose and helps ensure your program uses memory efficiently and correctly.

## Necessary Files for Running C++

To write and run a C++ program, you typically need:

- **Source file**: Contains your code, usually with a `.cpp` extension (e.g., `main.cpp`).
- **Header files** (optional): Contain declarations, usually with a `.h` or `.hpp` extension.

## Steps to Compile and Run a C++ Program

1. **Write your code** in a `.cpp` file.
2. **Open a terminal** and navigate to your project directory (run `bash ../../c_install.sh` if necessary).
3. **Compile the code** using a C++ compiler, such as `g++`:
    ```
    g++ main.cpp -o main
    ```
4. **Run the executable**:
    ```
    ./main
    ```

This process will turn your source code into a program you can execute!
