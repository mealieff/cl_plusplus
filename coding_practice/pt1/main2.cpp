// Welcome to the second coding exercise of part 1!
// Let's review data types, variables, and basic input/output operations in C++.

// What do you except this code to output? Write a print statement, run it, and see how you can make it output exactly what you want.

#include <iostream> 

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 3;
    int z = x / y;

}


// part two: rewrite so that it switches the output of y and x, printing them.
